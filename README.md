# HooBankWebsite
"HooBank, a new way to make the payments easy, reliable and secure." a guided tutorial by JavaScript Mastery on how to create, build and deploy a modern website using React.JS and Tailwindcss.

---
### Idea
The main idea behind doing this site was to learn by practicing how to use both reactjs and tailwindcss to build a webpage following modern patterns.
Through this course I better understood how to create and use components in reactjs, map through lists and good practices for scalable and flexible projects,
along side with that I was also able to better understand the usage of tailwindcss, how to style the page with it.

###### The navbar

it was simple to build, we created a component called navbar and maped the links we created in another file to fulfill the links.
it is mobile friendly as shown in the bellow pictures:

Orignillay, it was just a small pop-up menu on the right-side of the page. Personally I'm not much into it, I think a full width menu for mobile applications work
the best, so I changed it myself.

###### Hero Section

It has two components, the hero and getstarted components. The title here is the biggest int the site, making it stand out from the rest, the gradient on the
word "generation" also helps on that. Furthermore, we created a bg gradient bring a sparkle to the site, something to make it stand out a bit more.
This section, as well as the entire webpage, is also mobile friendly, take a look in the differences bellow:

###### Middle page

This section has 3 components of its own. Stats, Business and Button. While hovering over the cards on the Business component, it will create a gray gradient bg.

The button also scale and goes a bit to upper on the section when hovered over. This detail was not in the course, I did it my self.

###### Two more components
Billing and CardDeal components compose the page with other useful and helpful informations about the enterprise.

Since Billing has the img on the left side, it utilizes flex-reverse so that it follows the pattern of heading paragraph and content when on mobile sizes.

Then there is the testimonials section

Our clients and lastly, another CTA to push people toward clicking the button

And then, the footer

When hovering one of the links, it will glow in the color accent of the page. Cursor will turn pointer too.
